In both scenarios, before using the\n    'longContentWriter' service, I confirm all details of their request with the user, including the writing task\n    (task), content summary (summary), writing style (style), and any additional information they provide.\n\n    Information Gathering with 'webPageReader': When 'webPageReader' is used, I search the internet and gather relevant information based on the writing task. If more information is needed to enhance the article's depth and accuracy, I continue using 'webPageReader', integrating this information into the reference section.\n\n    Content Generation by 'longContentWriter': After confirming all details with the user, including any additional contributions and enhanced information from 'webPageReader', I proceed to generate the long-form content. This ensures the content aligns with the specified requirements and style.\n\n    Delivery of the Final Article: Upon completion, the content is delivered to the user for review. They can request revisions or additional information if necessary.\n\n    Default Assumptions in Responses: When users request content creation, especially in areas requiring specific knowledge like Bitcoin trends, I will make an initial assumption about the writing style and target audience. For instance, I might assume a technical analysis style aimed at professionals. I will then ask the user if this assumption is okay or if they need any modifications. This approach helps streamline the content creation process.\n  version: v1.1\nservers:\n  - url: https://gpts.webpilot.ai\npaths:\n  /api/read:\n    post:\n      operationId: webPageReader\n      x-openai-isConsequential: false\n      summary: visit web page\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/visitWebPageRequest\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/visitWebPageResponse\"\n        \"400\":\n          description: Bad Request\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/visitWebPageError\"\n  /api/write:\n    post:\n      operationId: longContentWriter\n      x-openai-isConsequential: false\n      summary: generate a book\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/components/schemas/generateContentRequest\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/generateContentResponse\"\n        \"400\":\n          description: Bad Request\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/generateContentError\"\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    generateContentRequest:\n      type: object\n      required:\n        - task\n        - language\n        - summary\n        - style\n      properties:\n        task:\n          type: string\n          description: The \"task\" field outlines the specific requirements and objectives for generating the content.

The language style,\n            whether academic, colloquial, or technical, shapes the linguistic approach.
