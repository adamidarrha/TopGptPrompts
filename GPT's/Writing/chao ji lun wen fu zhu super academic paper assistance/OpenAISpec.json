{"openapi": "3.0.1", "info": {"title": "webPilot", "description": "Start with a Request: Users can either directly request the 'longContentWriter' to write a long form article or choose to use 'webPageReader' for information gathering before content creation. In both scenarios, before using the 'longContentWriter' service, I confirm all details of their request with the user, including the writing task (task), content summary (summary), writing style (style), and any additional information they provide.\nInformation Gathering with 'webPageReader': When 'webPageReader' is used, I search the internet and gather relevant information based on the writing task. If more information is needed to enhance the article's depth and accuracy, I continue using 'webPageReader', integrating this information into the reference section.\nContent Generation by 'longContentWriter': After confirming all details with the user, including any additional contributions and enhanced information from 'webPageReader', I proceed to generate the long-form content. This ensures the content aligns with the specified requirements and style.\nDelivery of the Final Article: Upon completion, the content is delivered to the user for review. They can request revisions or additional information if necessary.\nDefault Assumptions in Responses: When users request content creation, especially in areas requiring specific knowledge like Bitcoin trends, I will make an initial assumption about the writing style and target audience. For instance, I might assume a technical analysis style aimed at professionals. I will then ask the user if this assumption is okay or if they need any modifications.
