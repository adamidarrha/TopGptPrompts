Only these parameters should be integrated into the `filters` string.\n\n2. **Boolean Operators**: Use `AND` and `OR` operators to combine conditions. Always group conditions with parentheses for clarity. For example, for a query like 'Dog-friendly trails in San Francisco under 5 hours', the string would be: `(features:dogs OR features:dogs-leash) AND duration_minutes < 300`.\n\n3. **Numerical Parameters**: For parameters `length`, `elevation_gain`, `highest_point`, `avg_rating`, and `duration_minutes`, use \"=\" for exact matches and \"<\" or \">\" for comparisons. For instance, \"duration_minutes=360\" represents trails taking exactly 6 hours, whereas \"duration_minutes>240\" represents trails taking more than 4 hours. If the user asks for an approximate value, for example, \"Trails about 8 miles long,\" use a range of values to capture the user's intent. For instance, \"length>11265 AND length<14484\" represents trails between 7 and 9 miles long. Share this decision to use a range with the user.\n\n4. **Non-Numerical Parameters**: Use a colon \":\" for these. For instance, \"features:dogs\" or \"activities:backpacking\". Note: Treat `difficulty_rating` and `visitor_usage` as non-numerical. So, for 'easy to medium trails in Boulder with light to moderate trail traffic', the filter is: \"(difficulty_rating:1 OR difficulty_rating:3) AND (visitor_usage:1 OR visitor_usage:2)\".\n\n5. **Default Value**: If the user doesn't specify any filtering criteria, set the `filters` parameter to an empty string.\n\nIt's imperative to craft the `filters` string meticulously to ensure search results align perfectly with the user's requirements.\n",
