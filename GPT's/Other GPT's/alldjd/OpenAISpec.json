Some of them are of a string-enum type: `activities`, `features`, `difficulty_rating`, `route_type`, `visitor_usage`. Others are numeric: `length`, `elevation_gain`, `highest_point`, `avg_rating`, and `duration_minutes`. Only these parameters should be integrated into the `filters` string and these parameters should NEVER be used outside of the filter string property.\n2. **Boolean Operators**: Use `AND` and `OR` operators to combine conditions. Always group conditions with parentheses for clarity. For example, for a query like 'Dog-friendly trails in San Francisco under 5 hours', the string would be: `(features:dogs OR features:dogs-leash) AND duration_minutes < 300`.\n3. **Numerical Parameters**: For parameters `length`, `elevation_gain`, `highest_point`, `avg_rating`, and `duration_minutes`, use \"=\" for exact matches and \"<\" or \">\" for comparisons. For instance, \"duration_minutes=360\" represents trails taking 6 hours, whereas \"duration_minutes>240\" represents trails taking more than 4 hours.\n4. **String-Enum Parameters**: Use a colon \":\" for these. For instance, \"features:dogs\" or \"activities:backpacking\".\n5. **Default Value**: If the user doesn't specify any filtering criteria, set the `filters` parameter to an empty string.\n\nBelow are the details of the various parameters (separated by horizontal rules) that can be used as part of the `filters` string:\n\n---\n\nThe 'activities' parameter (utilized only in the filters property) is used to filter trails based on specific outdoor activities they accommodate.\n\nMatch the user's mentioned activities with the provided enums. \nFor instance, if a user says 'trails with bike paths', then `(activities:mountain-biking OR activities:road-biking)` should be included in the `filters` string.\n\nHere is a dictionary describing the ONLY activities that are supported by this API:\n\n- backpacking: Outdoor recreation of carrying gear on one's back while hiking for more than a day.\n- birding: Bird-watching. Use this when the user is interested in watching birds.\n- camping: Camping. Use this when the user is asking for trails that go to, from, or through a campsite.\n- xc-skiing: The sport of skiing across the countryside (cross-country skiing), often through woods and usually on relatively flat terrain.\n- fishing: Fishing. Use this when the user is interested in trails that go to, from, or through a fishing spot.\n- hiking: The activity of going for long walks in the country or woods. Use this whenever a user mentions hiking.\n- horses: Use this when the user is looking for horseback riding trails or specifies that they are an equestrian.\n- mountain-biking: Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes.\n- off-road-driving: Off-roading is the activity of driving or riding in a vehicle on unpaved surfaces such as sand, dirt, gravel, riverbeds, mud, snow, rocks, and other natural terrain.\n- paddle-sports: Any sport involving the propulsion of a watercraft by means of a paddle. Kayaking and canoeing are paddlesports.\n- road-biking: Road cycling is the a form of cycling in which cyclists ride on paved roadways.\n- rock-climbing: The sport or activity of climbing rock faces, especially with the aid of ropes and special equipment.\n- scenic-driving: Scenic driving. Driving routes through areas with good views.\n- skiing: The action of traveling over snow on skis, especially as a sport or recreation.\n- snowshoeing: A very specific activity of walking over snow wearing snowshoes.\n- trail-running: Use this when the user is interested in trails supporting any running activity (running, jogging, trail running, etc.)\n- walking: Use this when the user is interested in trails supporting any casual walking activity (walking, strolling, etc.)\n- bike-touring: Bike touring. Bicycle touring can range from single-day trips to extended travels spanning weeks or months.\n- via-ferrata: A specific type of climbing route found in the Alps and certain other Alpine locations where the user hangs or clips onto cables.\n- whitewater-kayaking: The activity of paddling a kayak on whitewater (turbulent water).\n\nIf the user's mentioned activities don't align with the provided enums, inform the user of the available activity options and seek further clarification.\nIt's crucial to distinguish between `activities` and `features`. Activities typically involve actions, often ending in '-ing' (e.g. 'hiking', 'biking'). NEVER list features, such as 'dogs' or 'waterfall', under `activities`. Always cross-reference with the provided enums to ensure accuracy.\nOnly apply these activity-related parameters if the user explicitly mentions them in their query. For example, if the user simply implies that they are looking for trails \"in the winter\", don't automoatically assume that the user is looking for skiing or snowshoeing related trails.\n\n---\n\nThe 'features' parameter is employed to filter trails based on specific characteristics or attributes they possess, either inherent to the trail or related to its accessibility/suitability.\n\nPay close attention to the user's specific requirements regarding dogs:\n  - If a user inquires about 'dog-friendly trails', then use `(features:dogs AND features:dogs-leash)`. \n  - If a user specifies wanting trails where dogs are allowed without leashes, then use `features:dogs` only.\n  - If a user specifies a preference for trails where dogs must be on leashes, then use `features:dogs-leash` only.\n  - In the absence of specific instructions about leashes, include both ['dogs', 'dogs-leash'] to cover all dog-friendly trails.\n\nHere is a dictionary describing the ONLY features that are supported by this API:\n\n- ada: Trail is disabilities-friendly (e.g. wheelchairs, wheelchair friendly...etc)\n- beach: Trail features a beach.\n- cave: Trail features a cave.\n- dogs: Trail is dog friendly, doesn't require a leash. \n- dogs-leash: Trail is dog friendly, but requires a leash.\n- dogs-no: Trail is not dog friendly, no dogs are allowed.\n- forest: Trail features a forest.\n- lake: Trail features a lake.\n- kids: Trail is kid/child friendly. \n- hot-springs: Trail features hot springs.\n- paved: Trail is paved.\n- partially-paved: Trail is partially paved.\n- rails-trails: Trail follows railroad rails.\n- river: Trail features a river.\n- strollers: Trail is stroller friendly.\n- views: Trail has good views along it.\n- waterfall: Trail features a waterfall.\n- wild-flowers: Trail features wild flowers.\n- wildlife: Trail features wildlife (animals).\n- off-trail: Trails that involve a lot of bush-whacking and route finding.\n- no-shade: Trail is not situated well for users who want to avoid the sun.\n- city-walk: Urban trail routes going through the middle of cities.\n- historic-site: Trail is located in or by a historic site.\n- pub-crawl: Trails that are representative of pub crawls, the act of visiting multiple pubs or bars in a single session. Primarily used in the UK.\n- fee: Trail is not free OR requires a ticket to be purchased in order to access.\n\nIf the user's mentioned features don't correspond loosely with the provided enums, inform them of the available feature options and request further details. \nIt is essential that the assistant doesn't incorrectly apply an activity type as a feature or vice-versa.\n\n---\n\nThe 'difficulty_rating' parameter represents the trail's level of difficulty. It can be ONLY one of the following string values:\n\n- easy\n- moderate\n- hard\n\nFor example: If a user asks for 'easy trails', then `difficulty_rating:easy`.\n\n---\n\nThe 'route_type' parameter specifies the configuration or layout of the trail. It can be ONLY one of the following string values:\n\n- loop: The start and end points are the same.\n- out-and-back: One travels to a destination and then retraces their steps back to the starting point.\n- point-to-point: The trail starts and ends at different locations.\n\nFor example, if user asks for 'loop trails', then `route_type:loop`.\n\n---\n\nThe 'visitor_usage' parameter represents the level of traffic on the trail. It can be ONLY one of the following string values:\n\n- light\n- moderate\n- heavy\n- extreme\n\nFor example, if user asks for 'trails with light to moderate trail traffic', then `visitor_usage:light OR visitor_usage:moderate`.\n\n---\n\nThe 'length' parameter is a number that represents the length of a trail in meters.\n\nFor example, if user asks for 'trails that are 1 mile long', then `length=1609.34`.\n\nPerform arithmetic to calculate the total length of the trail as a trip, if needed.\n\n---\n\nThe 'elevation_gain' parameter is a number that represents the elevation gain of a trail in meters.\n\nFor example, if user asks for 'trails with 6000 ft elevation gain', then `elevation_gain=1828.8`.\n\n---\n\nThe 'highest_point' parameter is a number that represents the highest point on a trail in meters.\n\nFor example, if user asks for 'trails with a highest point of 8000 ft', then `highest_point=2438.4`.\n\n---\n\nThe 'avg_rating' parameter is a number that represents the average user rating for a trail based on a 5-star scale (ranges from 1 to 5).\n\nFor example, if a user asks for 'trails rated 4.2 stars', then `avg_rating=4.2'.\n\nIf the user specifies a rating outside the 1-5 range or provides a non-integer value, inform them of the available options and seek clarification.\n\n---\n\nThe 'duration_minutes' parameter is numerical and indicates the average time, in minutes, that AllTrails users typically take to complete a trail.\n\nFor example, if they ask for 'trails that can be completed in an hour', then `duration_minutes=60`\n\n---\n\nIt's imperative to craft the `filters` string meticulously using all of the details provided above to ensure search results align perfectly with the user's requirements.\n", "schema": {"type": "string", "default": ""}}}, "required": ["country_name", "raw_query", "filters"]}, "Trail": {"type": "object", "properties": {"trail_name": {"description": "Represents the 'og:title' OpenGraph tag, which indicates the name of the trail. \n**Display Instructions for the assistant's UI**:\n- Text: Use the value of this field (`trail_name`).\n- Formatting: Bold the text.\n- Hyperlink: Link the text to the URL specified in the `hyperlink_url` field of the JSON response.\n- **Desired Output**: [**Trail Name from `trail_name`**](URL from `hyperlink_url`)\n", "schema": {"type": "string"}}, "hyperlink_url": {"description": "Represents the 'og:url' OpenGraph tag, which provides the URL associated with the trail.", "schema": {"type": "url"}}, "location": {"description": "A comma-separated string that provides the full location of the trail, including components like city, state, and country.", "schema": {"type": "string"}}, "description": {"description": "Short description of the trail.", "schema": {"type": "string"}}, "difficulty_rating": {"description": "The difficulty rating of the trail.", "schema": {"enum": ["Easy", "Moderate", "Hard", "Unknown"], "type": "string"}}, "elevation_gain": {"description": "The elevation gain of the trail.\n", "schema": {"type": "string"}}, "length": {"description": "The length of the trail.\n", "schema": {"type": "string"}}, "estimated_completion_time": {"description": "The estimated hiking time for trail completion.\n", "schema": {"type": "string"}}, "star_rating": {"description": "The average star rating of the trail by AllTrails users, fetched from AllTrails.\n", "schema": {"type": "number"}}, "image": {"description": "A shortened URL to an image. \nTo access the image, make a GET request to image.
